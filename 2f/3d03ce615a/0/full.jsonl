I built the full Falcon-512 verification in one afternoon — types, hash function, signature checking, cross-language tests. Then spent the next afternoon cutting it by 37%.\n\n132k Cairo steps. The 230k target from Day 1 is beaten.\n\n## Post 2\nThe hash function was the interesting design problem. Falcon needs to hash a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling: extract 16 bits, reject if biased, retry. That's branching and variable-length loops, expensive in a ZK VM.\n\nBlake2s would be ideal — native opcode, 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon — but I asked @Starkware and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is.\n\n## Post 3\nI looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely and extract more bits per coefficient instead. The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n\nWith 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Rényi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n\n## Post 4\nSo I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n\n22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n\n## Post 5\nThe BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n\nBut the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n\n## Post 6\nI also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n\nTwo NTTs, zero INTTs.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n\n## Post 7\nThen I found a free optimization 😆. I originally wrote a custom absorb function for the Poseidon sponge — rate-2 absorption, padding, domain separation, the whole thing. Then I realized Cairo's built-in poseidon_hash_span does the exact same thing. Replaced 20 lines with one function call. 33% gas reduction on hash_to_point.\n\n## Post 8\nThe next day I went on an optimization sprint. 7 commits in one afternoon.\n\nThe verification had three separate 512-element loops: multiply and check the hint, subtract to get s0, compute both norms. I fused them into a single pass. Then unrolled with multi_pop_front K=8. 210k → 132k steps.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_optimization_waterfall.png\n\n## Post 9\nI also built a companion Rust crate (falcon-rs) with a generic hash trait — swap SHAKE256 for Poseidon. It passes NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors for standard Falcon. Same keygen and signing; only the hash changes.\n\nRust generates all the Cairo test data. Cairo deserializes and checks element-by-element. 27 Cairo tests, 61 Rust tests. https://github.com/feltroidprime/falcon-rs\n\n## Post 10\n132k steps, down from 800k on Day 1. -83.5%.\n\nNext: wiring this into an actual account contract. __validate__ calls verify, public key in storage packed into 29 felt252 slots, signature + hint in calldata. When Blake2s ships in 0.14.2, @zknoxhq's hash-to-point drops in and we move toward spec-compliant Falcon on a live network.

Two teams independently wrote the same 10,000-line file. Same algorithm, same language, same brutal unrolled approach. One runs 4x faster. The difference is one design decision.\n     6→\n     7→That 4x puts Falcon verification under the 230k steps target from Day 1.\n     8→\n     9→---\n    10→\n    11→## Post 2 (Discovery)\n    12→\n    13→I found them through @asanso's post-quantum Ethereum working group with @drakefjustin and @tcoratger. @RenaudDUBOIS10 and @SimonMasson2 from @zknoxhq built a Falcon NTT in Cairo too — fully inlined, no arrays, no function calls. I assumed similar performance and had to benchmark it.\n    14→\n    15→---\n    16→\n    17→## Post 3 (Shift strategy)\n    18→\n    19→> ATTACH: `ntt_shift_diagram.png`\n    20→\n    21→Both implementations unroll the NTT into ~10k lines of raw felt252 arithmetic. The first difference is how they handle negative intermediates from butterfly operations. zknox shifts every subtraction back to positive immediately; I let values go negative through all 9 stages and shift once at the end.\n    22→\n    23→---\n    24→\n    25→## Post 4 (Reduction width)\n    26→\n    27→> ATTACH: `ntt_comparison_code.png`\n    28→\n    29→The second difference is reduction. zknox reduces from u256. The compiler I built on Day 3 tracks bounds through the whole circuit and knows the max value is 122 bits — it fits in u128, which is way cheaper to reduce in Cairo. This is where most of the 4x comes from.\n    30→\n    31→---\n    32→\n    33→## Post 5 (BoundedInt correction)\n    34→\n    35→A correction from Day 2 on BoundedInt: using it for every operation actually overwhelmed the compiler at this scale. The compiler still tracks worst-case bounds internally, so it knows when overflow checks are unnecessary and computes the exact shift needed to bring negative values back to positive. I added a felt252 hybrid mode where arithmetic stays in felt252 and BoundedInt kicks in only at the final div_mod reductions. Same win, less pressure on the compiler.\n    36→\n    37→---\n    38→\n    39→## Post 6 (Results)\n    40→\n    41→> ATTACH: `ntt_comparison_bars.png`\n    42→\n    43→15,353 steps — down from 34k on Day 3 and 185k on Day 2. The NTT was supposed to be the bottleneck; it's 7% of the verification budget now.\n    44→\n    45→---\n    46→\n    47→## Post 7 (Hash problem)\n    48→\n    49→NTT is done; next problem is hashing. Falcon hashes a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289, and the spec uses SHAKE256, but that's way too expensive in Cairo. Blake2s would be ideal — it's a native opcode and 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon. I asked Starkware, and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is for now.\n    50→\n    51→---\n    52→\n    53→## Post 8 (Hash trick)\n    54→\n    55→The standard hash-to-point uses rejection sampling: you extract 16 bits, reject biased values, and retry. That's a 6% rejection rate and requires branching. I was about to implement it, then looked at how Miden does their Falcon. They skip rejection entirely.\n    56→\n    57→The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, you can extract more bits and reduce directly. Poseidon gives 251 bits per element; q is 14 bits. You skip rejection, branching, and retries entirely.\n    58→\n    59→---\n    60→\n    61→## Post 9 (Blake2s — zknox collab)\n    62→\n    63→@zknoxhq already built a Blake2s hash-to-point for Falcon in Cairo — about 34 calls for 512 coefficients. Once 0.14.2 lands, we'll integrate it. Two teams building complementary pieces.\n    64→\n    65→---\n    66→\n    67→## Post 10 (falcon-rs)\n    68→\n    69→I'm building the client side too. Rust port of Falcon-512 with a generic hash trait — you can swap SHAKE256 for Poseidon or any ZK-friendly hash. Keygen, signing, and verification all pass NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors. This becomes the WASM signer for browser wallets. https://github.com/feltroidprime/falcon-rs\n    70→\n    71→---\n    72→\n    73→## Post 11 (Closer)\n    74→\n    75→The NTT costs 15k steps and the hash pipeline is ready.

The verification works. End to end. Falcon-512 signature generated in Rust, verified in Cairo with Poseidon hashing, cross-language test suite passing. But the interesting part isn't that it works — it's that verification only touches 2 NTTs and 0 inverse NTTs.\n     6→\n     7→---\n     8→\n     9→## Post 2 (The hint trick)\n    10→\n    11→Falcon verification normally requires computing h*s1 mod q in the NTT domain, which means: NTT the signature, multiply, INTT back, check the norm. Three transforms. An INTT costs the same as an NTT, so that's 45k steps just in transforms.\n    12→\n    13→Instead I moved the INTT off-chain. The signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. On-chain, the verifier just re-does the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt. Two NTTs, zero INTTs.\n    14→\n    15→---\n    16→\n    17→## Post 3 (Hash-to-point with Poseidon)\n    18→\n    19→Hash-to-point converts a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The Falcon spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling — expensive in Cairo. I use Poseidon instead.\n    20→\n    21→Poseidon gives 251-bit outputs. 12289 is 14 bits. I split each felt252 into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with a DivRem chain — divide by q, take the remainder, repeat. 12 coefficients per felt252. 22 Poseidon permutations for all 512.\n    22→\n    23→No rejection sampling. No branching. The Rényi divergence argument from the Falcon spec (page 31) says you need ~50 bits per coefficient for <1 bit of security loss. We extract from 128-bit and 124-bit chunks. Overkill.\n    24→\n    25→---\n    26→\n    27→## Post 4 (poseidon_hash_span — the refactor)\n    28→\n    29→> ATTACH: gas comparison screenshot if available\n    30→\n    31→I originally wrote a custom absorb function for the Poseidon sponge. Then I realized Cairo's built-in `poseidon_hash_span` does the exact same thing — rate-2 absorption, pad with 1, domain separation, final permutation. Replaced my code with one function call. 33% gas reduction on hash_to_point.\n    32→\n    33→---\n    34→\n    35→## Post 5 (Packing)\n    36→\n    37→512 public key coefficients need to live on-chain. Each is 14 bits; a felt252 holds 251 bits. I pack 18 coefficients per slot — 29 felt252s for a full key. That's the same storage as ~1 EVM address worth of calldata.\n    38→\n    39→---\n    40→\n    41→## Post 6 (Cross-language test suite)\n    42→\n    43→I built a companion Rust crate (falcon-rs) with a generic hash trait — swap SHAKE256 for Poseidon or anything else. It generates all the test vectors: hash-to-point outputs, packing round-trips, full verify inputs with hints. Cairo deserializes the JSON and checks element-by-element. 27 Cairo tests, 61 Rust tests, everything green.\n    44→\n    45→The Rust crate passes NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors for standard Falcon. The Poseidon variant uses the same keygen and signing math; only the hash function changes.\n    46→\n    47→---\n    48→\n    49→## Post 7 (Where we stand)\n    50→\n    51→The pieces:\n    52→- NTT: 15k steps (Day 4)\n    53→- Hash-to-point: ~3.4M gas with Poseidon (will drop hard with Blake2s)\n    54→- Hint verification: 2 NTTs + pointwise mul + norm check\n    55→- Packing: 29 storage slots for a public key\n    56→- Cross-language test suite: Rust generates, Cairo verifies\n    57→\n    58→Still need to benchmark the full verify end-to-end and see where it lands against the 230k steps target from Day 1.\n    59→\n    60→---\n    61→\n    62→## Post 8 (Closer)\n    63→\n    64→Next is wiring this into an actual account contract — `__validate__` calls `verify<PoseidonHashToPoint>`, public key lives in contract storage, signatures arrive as calldata with the hint attached. When Starknet 0.14.2 ships Blake2s to contracts, @zknoxhq's hash-to-point drops in and we're closer to spec-compliant Falcon on a live network.

Let me create a comprehensive summary of the patterns for Day 5 implementation.\n\n## Summary: Day 5 Implementation Patterns\n\nBased on my analysis of existing files, here's what I found:\n\n### 1. **Tokyo Night Color Palette** (Shared across all visuals)\n\nLocated in both `thread_visuals.py` and `hash_tradeoff.py`:\n\n```python\nBG = \"#1a1b26\"           # Dark background\nBG_PANEL = \"#24283b\"     # Panel background\nFG = \"#c0caf5\"           # Foreground text\nCOMMENT = \"#565f89\"      # Dimmed comments\nKEYWORD = \"#bb9af7\"      # Purple\nTYPE = \"#7dcfff\"         # Cyan\nNUMBER = \"#ff9e64\"       # Orange\nSTRING = \"#9ece6a\"       # Green\nOPERATOR = \"#89ddff\"     # Light cyan\nACCENT_GREEN = \"#9ece6a\"\nACCENT_CYAN = \"#7dcfff\"\nACCENT_RED = \"#f7768e\"\nACCENT_ORANGE = \"#ff9e64\"\nWHITE = \"#ffffff\"\nDIM_WHITE = \"#a9b1d6\"\nSEPARATOR = \"#3b4261\"\n\nMONO = \"DejaVu Sans Mono\"\nSANS = \"DejaVu Sans\"\nDPI = 200\n```\n\n### 2. **Image Generation Patterns**\n\n**From `thread_visuals.py`:**\n- Uses `matplotlib.use(\"Agg\")` for non-interactive backend\n- Sets style with `plt.style.use(\"dark_background\")`\n- Updates `plt.rcParams` globally for consistent styling\n- Outputs to `OUTPUT_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / \"thread_output\"`\n- Common figures: 14-16 inch width, 6-7 inch height at DPI=200\n- Uses `FancyBboxPatch` for rounded boxes with `boxstyle=\"round,pad=0.02\"`\n- Uses monospace fonts for code with `ax.text(..., fontfamily=MONO, fontsize=9.5)`\n\n**From `hash_tradeoff.py`:**\n- Syntax-aware styling with custom color mapping for Cairo code\n- Line-by-line syntax highlighting function `_syntax_color()`\n- Supports keywords, types, numbers, operators, comments\n- Uses axes-relative positioning with `transform=ax.transAxes`\n- Character width estimation for monospace: `offset += len(text_chunk) * 0.0138`\n\n### 3. **Matplotlib Styling Patterns**\n\n**Common setup pattern:**\n```python\ndef _setup_style():\n    plt.style.use(\"dark_background\")\n    plt.rcParams.update({\n        \"figure.facecolor\": BG,\n        \"axes.facecolor\": BG,\n        \"savefig.facecolor\": BG,\n        \"text.color\": FG,\n        \"font.family\": \"sans-serif\",\n        \"font.sans-serif\": [SANS],\n    })\n```\n\n**Panel backgrounds:**\n- `ax.set_facecolor(BG_PANEL)` for individual axes\n- `FancyBboxPatch` with `edgecolor=SEPARATOR, linewidth=1.5` for decorative borders\n\n**Annotations:**\n- Use `ax.annotate()` with arrows for callouts\n- `arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"...\", color=..., lw=...)`\n- Positioning with `xy=` and `xytext=` tuples\n\n### 4. **thread.md Format** (from Day 4 example)\n\n**Structure:**\n```markdown\n# [Title] — [Context]\n\n## Post 1 (Hook — quote Day N)\n[Opening hook text]\n\n---\n\n## Post 2 (Topic)\n[Content]\n\n> ATTACH: filename.png\n\n[More content]\n\n---\n\n## Post N (Final)\n[Closer text]\n```\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Post 1 always opens with `[DAY N]` tag (hooks previous day or self)\n- Post separators are `---` on their own line\n- Images attached with `> ATTACH: filename.png` syntax\n- Generally 8-12 posts per thread\n- Day 4 example has 11 posts\n- Posts range from 280-380 characters each\n\n**Day 4 topics covered:**\n1. Hook referencing Day 3 results (4x speedup)\n2. Discovery of zknox implementation\n3. Shift strategy diagram explanation\n4. Reduction width optimization\n5. BoundedInt vs hybrid mode\n6. Results visualization\n7. Hash-to-point problem setup\n8. Hash trick (rejection sampling skip)\n9. Blake2s collaboration\n10. Rust client-side library\n11. Closing remarks\n\n### 5. **thread.py CLI Interface**\n\n**Push command pattern:**\n```bash\npython scripts/thread/thread.py push scripts/thread/threads/day5/thread.md\npython scripts/thread/thread.py push scripts/thread/threads/day5/thread.md --update DRAFT_ID\npython scripts/thread/thread.py push scripts/thread/threads/day5/thread.md --dry-run\n```\n\n**Key behaviors:**\n- Parses `## Post N` sections from markdown\n- First `# ` header becomes thread title\n- Looks for `reply_to:` metadata line\n- Stores draft state in `.typefully_state.json` alongside markdown\n- Auto-detects previous draft ID from state file\n- Can update existing draft or create new one\n- Returns `draft_id` and `private_url`\n\n**Parse logic:**\n- Skips `---` lines between posts\n- Strips leading/trailing whitespace from post content\n- Posts must match `^## Post \\d+` header pattern\n\n### 6. **Day 5 Skeleton Structure** (Existing template)\n\n**Posts 1-8:**\n1. Hook: Verification works end-to-end with 2 NTTs + 0 INTTs\n2. Hint trick: Move INTT offline\n3. Hash-to-point with Poseidon (no rejection sampling)\n4. `poseidon_hash_span` refactor (33% gas reduction)\n5. Packing (18 coeffs per felt252, 29 slots total)\n6. Cross-language test suite (Rust + Cairo)\n7. Where we stand (component costs)\n8. Closer: Wiring into account contract\n\n**Expected visuals references:**\n- Post 4: Gas comparison screenshot\n- Potentially other diagrams for packing or test architecture\n\n### 7. **File Organization**\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```\nscripts/thread/\n├── visuals/\n│   ├── thread_visuals.py       # NTT comparison visuals\n│   ├── hash_tradeoff.py        # Hash algorithm tradeoffs\n│   └── thread_output/          # Generated PNGs\n├── threads/\n│   ├── day4/\n│   │   ├── thread.md           # Source markdown\n│   │   ├── published.md        # Published version\n│   │   └── media/              # PNG/JPG from Typefully\n│   ├── day5/\n│   │   └── skeleton.md         # Template for Day 5\n│   └── media/                  # Shared media assets\n└── thread.py                   # CLI tool\n```\n\n**Output locations:**\n- Visuals: `scripts/thread/visuals/thread_output/`\n- Markdown state: `scripts/thread/threads/day5/thread.md`\n- State file: `scripts/thread/threads/day5/thread.md.typefully_state.json`\n- Downloaded media: `scripts/thread/threads/day5/media/`\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive overview shows:\n- **Consistent color palette** across all visualizations\n- **Reusable matplotlib patterns** for dark-mode technical graphics\n- **Specific markdown format** for thread posts with standardized post numbering\n- **CLI workflow** using `thread.py` for pushing to Typefully\n- **Day 5 template** already exists with 8 posts covering verification, hashing, and testing\n- **Absolute file paths** for output and state management"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a923aaa (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 49755\ntool_uses: 13\nduration_ms: 44753</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"75289554-c02a-431b-972e-d5af456c7590","timestamp":"2026-02-16T13:46:22.917Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the existing patterns for Day 5 implementation.

I built the full Falcon-512 verification in one afternoon — types, hash function, signature checking, cross-language tests. Then spent the next afternoon cutting it by 37%.\n\n132k Cairo steps. The 230k target from Day 1 is beaten.\n\n---\n\n## Post 2\nThe hash function was the interesting design problem. Falcon needs to hash a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling: extract 16 bits, reject if biased, retry. That's branching and variable-length loops, expensive in a ZK VM.\n\nBlake2s would be ideal — native opcode, 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon — but I asked @Starkware and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is.\n\n---\n\n## Post 3\nI looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely and extract more bits per coefficient instead. The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n\nWith 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Renyi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n\n---\n\n## Post 4\nSo I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n\n22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 5\nThe BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n\nBut the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n\n---\n\n## Post 6\nI also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n\nTwo NTTs, zero INTTs.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 7\nThen I found a free optimization. I originally wrote a custom absorb function for the Poseidon sponge — rate-2 absorption, padding, domain separation, the whole thing. Then I realized Cairo's built-in poseidon_hash_span does the exact same thing. Replaced 20 lines with one function call. 33% gas reduction on hash_to_point.\n\n---\n\n## Post 8\nThe next day I went on an optimization sprint. 7 commits in one afternoon.\n\nThe verification had three separate 512-element loops: multiply and check the hint, subtract to get s0, compute both norms. I fused them into a single pass. Then unrolled with multi_pop_front K=8. 210k to 132k steps.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_optimization_waterfall.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 9\nI also built a companion Rust crate (falcon-rs) with a generic hash trait — swap SHAKE256 for Poseidon. It passes NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors for standard Falcon. Same keygen and signing; only the hash changes.\n\nRust generates all the Cairo test data. Cairo deserializes and checks element-by-element. 27 Cairo tests, 61 Rust tests. https://github.com/feltroidprime/falcon-rs\n\n---\n\n## Post 10\n132k steps, down from 800k on Day 1. -83.5%.\n\nNext: wiring this into an actual account contract. __validate__ calls verify, public key in storage packed into 29 felt252 slots, signature + hint in calldata.

I built the full Falcon-512 verification in one afternoon — types, hash function, signature checking, cross-language tests. Then spent the next afternoon cutting it by 37%.\n\n132k Cairo steps. The 230k target from Day 1 is beaten.\n\n---\n\n## Post 2\nThe hash function was the interesting design problem. Falcon needs to hash a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling: extract 16 bits, reject if biased, retry. That's branching and variable-length loops, expensive in a ZK VM.\n\nBlake2s would be ideal — native opcode, 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon — but I asked @Starkware and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is.\n\n---\n\n## Post 3\nI looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely and extract more bits per coefficient instead. The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n\nWith 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Renyi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n\n---\n\n## Post 4\nSo I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n\n22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 5\nThe BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n\nBut the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n\n---\n\n## Post 6\nI also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n\nTwo NTTs, zero INTTs.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 7\nThen I found a free optimization. I originally wrote a custom absorb function for the Poseidon sponge — rate-2 absorption, padding, domain separation, the whole thing. Then I realized Cairo's built-in poseidon_hash_span does the exact same thing. Replaced 20 lines with one function call. 33% gas reduction on hash_to_point.\n\n---\n\n## Post 8\nThe next day I went on an optimization sprint. 7 commits in one afternoon.\n\nThe verification had three separate 512-element loops: multiply and check the hint, subtract to get s0, compute both norms. I fused them into a single pass. Then unrolled with multi_pop_front K=8. 210k to 132k steps.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_optimization_waterfall.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 9\nI also built a companion Rust crate (falcon-rs) with a generic hash trait — swap SHAKE256 for Poseidon. It passes NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors for standard Falcon. Same keygen and signing; only the hash changes.\n\nRust generates all the Cairo test data. Cairo deserializes and checks element-by-element. 27 Cairo tests, 61 Rust tests. https://github.com/feltroidprime/falcon-rs\n\n---\n\n## Post 10\n132k steps, down from 800k on Day 1. -83.5%.\n\nNext: wiring this into an actual account contract. __validate__ calls verify, public key in storage packed into 29 felt252 slots, signature + hint in calldata.

The dry-run shows this is fine since the Day 4 thread also had similar lengths.\n\n\nThe character counts for posts 2, 3, and 5 are 444, 486, and 467 respectively — quite substantial, but the Day 4 thread had similarly long posts with mentions and tags, so this aligns with the user having X Premium. I should note that the `> ATTACH:` lines factor into the character count as well. they're metadata, not actual tweet content. Let me just proceed and push to Typefully. The user can edit in the Typefully UI.\n\nActually wait - let me look at the char counts more carefully. Posts with `> ATTACH:` have that text counted but it won't be in the actual tweet. So:\n- Post 4 (404 chars) includes `> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png` (37 chars) → actual ~367\n- Post 6 (375 chars) includes `> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png` (33 chars) → actual ~342\n- Post 8 (335 chars) includes `> ATTACH: day5_optimization_waterfall.png` (43 chars) → actual ~292\n\nBut posts 2, 3, and 5 don't have ATTACH lines and are still 444, 486, and 467 chars respectively. Those would definitely exceed a 280-char limit, though the Day 4 threads seemed to allow longer posts, probably because the user has X Premium. Looking at how the markdown parser handles ATTACH lines, it doesn't strip them out - they'd get sent to Typefully as part of the post text. Since those are just notes for manual image insertion, I should just push everything as-is and let the user clean up the formatting in the Typefully UI.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":482,"cache_read_input_tokens":76528,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":482},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBrVW65Q55V4vREvsXt6","type":"assistant","uuid":"912a02b5-4321-42ac-9354-ac9a4e2d6d1e","timestamp":"2026-02-16T13:49:33.735Z"}

Don't repeat ideas across posts — if the hook says it, the body doesn't say it again.\n    70→\n    71→## Format\n    72→\n    73→- Each thread quotes the previous one. Post 1 quotes the previous Day's tweet.\n    74→- Hook starts with `[DAY X] of building a Quantum wallet for @Starknet.`\n    75→- The closer should tease something specific with real stakes — \"If X happens, then Y.\" End with \"Let's see.\"\n    76→- The last two posts (closer + second-to-last) are the most read after the hook. Make them count.\n    77→\n    78→## Running Narratives\n    79→\n    80→### Performance target\n    81→Day 1 established ~230k Cairo steps as the target (cost of secp256r1 signature verification on Starknet). Every optimization is measured against this.\n    82→\n    83→### The compiler\n    84→Built on Day 3. A Python-to-Cairo compiler that takes arithmetic circuits and generates fully unrolled felt252 code. It tracks worst-case bounds internally, computes shifts, and uses BoundedInt only at final reductions (felt252 hybrid mode). This is the core technical advantage.\n    85→\n    86→### BoundedInt arc\n    87→Day 2 introduced BoundedInt as the optimization. Day 3 built the compiler around it. Day 4 corrected Day 2 — using BoundedInt for every op overwhelmed the compiler; the hybrid mode is the real win. This correction is an honest, running narrative.\n    88→\n    89→### zknox collaboration\n    90→@zknoxhq (@RenaudDUBOIS10, @SimonMasson2) built a Falcon NTT in Cairo independently. Found through @asanso's PQ Ethereum working group. Two teams, complementary work — they have Blake2s hash-to-point, we have the faster NTT.\n    91→\n    92→### 230k steps budget breakdown\n    93→- NTT: 15,353 steps (7% of budget) — solved\n    94→- Hash-to-point: Poseidon available now, Blake2s coming April (Starknet 0.14.2)\n    95→- Full verification circuit: open question — will it fit under 230k?\n    96→\n    97→## Previous Threads Summary\n    98→\n    99→### Day 1\n   100→Hook: \"Quantum computers will eventually break every wallet on Ethereum.\"\n   101→Content: Cloned s2morrow, benchmarked Falcon-512 at ~800k steps. Too much. Profiled, found secp256r1 costs ~230k — that's the target. \"I have a theory on how to cut this in half. We'll see if I'm wrong tomorrow.\"\n   102→\n   103→### Day 2\n   104→Hook: \"I found a 65% overhead in the Falcon-512 verification. Not math related, it's just the CairoLang VM fighting itself. I've killed this pattern before and I'll do it again.\"\n   105→Content: 65% overhead from store_temp, array ops, downcasts. Cut 20% with BoundedInt. Proposed bounded_int_circuit.py — a compiler for arithmetic circuits using BoundedInt. \"The fix is to use one fully inlined function. Probably ~4000 lines.\"\n   106→\n   107→### Day 3\n   108→Hook: \"Making gangster progress. Turned an elegant NTT algorithm into a brutal 30k-line assembly file. It's nasty but 5x faster.\"\n   109→Content: Built BoundedIntCircuit class. Generated NTT — 34,431 steps vs 185,992. Mentioned bytecode-steps tradeoff. \"See you soon.\"\n   110→\n   111→### Day 4\n   112→Hook: \"Two teams independently wrote the same 10,000-line file. One runs 4x faster. The difference is one design decision.\"\n   113→Content: Compared with zknox — shift strategy (every op vs once at end) and reduction width (u256 vs u128). BoundedInt correction (hybrid mode). Hash-to-point: skip rejection sampling via Falcon spec page 31. falcon-rs Rust port passing NIST test vectors. \"If the whole thing comes in under 230k steps, we have a deployable post-quantum account contract for @Starknet. Let's see.\"\n   114→\n   115→## Open Threads for Day 5\n   116→\n   117→- Full Falcon verification circuit — does it fit under 230k?\n   118→- Hash-to-point implementation with Poseidon\n   119→- Account contract integration\n   120→- Bytecode-steps tradeoff (mentioned Day 3, never resolved)\n   121→- Blake2s integration when 0.14.2 drops\n   122→"}]},"uuid":"f0bf8102-21ec-44dc-a9de-834edd6ac494","timestamp":"2026-02-16T13:56:17.618Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"Thoroughly explore the /home/felt/PycharmProjects/s2morrow/scripts/thread/ directory.

No arrays, no recursion, no \"if-else\", no data copying, no abstraction over the size of the signature.... 😴 \n   137→Pure computation signal. \n   138→I love these kind of files :D\n   139→![](threads/day2/media/post8_6eb50c07.png)\n   140→\n   141→9/11\n   142→In @GaragaStarknet, I built a Python-to-Cairo compiler \"modulo_circuit.py\" for arithmetic circuits over emulated (large) integers in this file https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/garaga/blob/main/hydra/garaga/modulo_circuit.py\n   143→\n   144→It'll be the same idea here. \n   145→\n   146→Except that we'll compile the Falcon verification to an arithmetic circuit using Bounded Ints (small integers). \n   147→Probably bounded_int_circuit.py ?\n   148→\n   149→10/11\n   150→Externalizing myself in .md files is harder than expected.

The reasoning is deeper than I thought.\n   151→More Skills to refine.\n   152→\n   153→11/11\n   154→So next up: bounded_int_circuit.py\n   155→A compiler that turns any arithmetic circuit into pure bounded int operations.\n   156→Then we'll be able to build a quantum wallet that scales.\n   157→\n   158→---\n   159→\n   160→## Day 3 — Published 2026-01-30\n   161→url: https://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2017277443510514149\n   162→\n   163→1/9\n   164→[DAY 3] of building a Quantum wallet of @Starknet \n   165→Making gangster progress. Turned an elegant NTT algorithm into a brutal 30k-line assembly file.\n   166→It's nasty but 5x faster.\n   167→\n   168→2/9\n   169→I asked Claude to create a BoundedIntCircuit class, taking inspiration from what I've did in Garaga at the time. You define the initial bounds and the sequence of operations in Python and it will generate a Cairo function with all the correct bounds implementations.\n   170→![](threads/day3/media/post2_b176babb.png)\n   171→![](threads/day3/media/post2_62b37ca5.png)\n   172→\n   173→3/9\n   174→Then I asked him to define a BoundedIntCircuit for a NTT of size 512.\n   175→The generated file is crazy at this point 😆 but exactly how I like them.\n   176→![](threads/day3/media/post3_93f2216f.mp4)\n   177→\n   178→4/9\n   179→The results speak for themselves. The fully inlined bounded int version of the NTT takes 34 431 Cairo Steps vs 185 992 for the previous version. \n   180→That's a -81.4% reduction !\n   181→![](threads/day3/media/post4_e7985142.png)\n   182→\n   183→5/9\n   184→To verify the full Falcon signature, more work needs to be done, but NTT was the base brick.

Claude unnecessary slow to converge due to silly things in cairo tooling.\n   189→\n   190→7/9\n   191→Additionally, I'm not sure what is the size of the compiled bytecode size, if it's too large for Starknet, I might need to break down the ntt circuit in smaller parts at the cost of a small overhead, to find a sweet spot. \n   192→I call this the \"bytecode-steps trade-off\"\n   193→\n   194→8/9\n   195→So, it's time to spend 1 or 2 full days to upgrade my Cairo Agentic setup. I want it to become ultra smooth, using the right skills, hooks, session starts hooks and more.

Two teams independently wrote the same 10,000-line file. Same algorithm, same language, same brutal unrolled approach. One runs 4x faster. The difference is one subtle design decision.\n   207→\n   208→That 4x puts Falcon verification under the 230k steps target from Day 1.\n   209→\n   210→2/11\n   211→I found them through @asanso's post-quantum Ethereum working group with @drakefjustin and @tcoratger. @RenaudDUBOIS10 and @SimonMasson2 from @zknoxhq built a Falcon NTT in Cairo too — fully inlined, no arrays, no function calls. I assumed similar performance and had to benchmark it.\n   212→\n   213→3/11\n   214→Both implementations unroll the NTT into ~10k lines of raw felt252 arithmetic. The first difference is how they handle negative intermediates from butterfly operations. zknox shifts every subtraction back to positive immediately; I let values go negative through all 9 stages and shift once at the end.\n   215→![](threads/day4/media/post3_61b2b2a3.png)\n   216→\n   217→4/11\n   218→The second difference is reduction. zknox reduces from u256. The compiler I built on Day 3 tracks bounds through the whole circuit and knows the max value is 122 bits — it fits in u128, which is way cheaper to reduce in Cairo. This is where most of the 4x comes from.\n   219→![](threads/day4/media/post4_27a038bc.png)\n   220→\n   221→5/11\n   222→A correction from Day 2 on BoundedInt: using it for every operation actually overwhelmed the compiler at this scale. The compiler still tracks worst-case bounds internally, so it knows when overflow checks are unnecessary and computes the exact shift needed to bring negative values back to positive. I added a felt252 hybrid mode where arithmetic stays in felt252 and BoundedInt kicks in only at the final div_mod reductions. Same win, less pressure on the compiler.\n   223→\n   224→6/11\n   225→15,353 steps — down from 34k on Day 3 and 185k on Day 2. The NTT was supposed to be the bottleneck; it's only 7% of the verification budget now. 🚀\n   226→![](threads/day4/media/post6_80863c0a.png)\n   227→\n   228→7/11\n   229→NTT is done; next problem is hashing. Falcon hashes a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289, and the spec uses SHAKE256, but that's way too expensive in Cairo. Blake2s would be ideal — it's a native opcode and 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon. I asked @Starkware eng. team, and it won't be available to contracts until Starknet 0.14.2 in April. So Poseidon it is for now.\n   230→\n   231→8/11\n   232→The standard hash-to-point uses rejection sampling: you extract 16 bits, reject biased values, and retry. That's a 6% rejection rate and requires branching. I was about to implement it, then looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely.\n   233→\n   234→The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, you can extract more bits and reduce directly. The minimum needed is >~50 bits for q at 14 bits. You skip rejection, branching, and retries entirely.\n   235→\n   236→9/11\n   237→@zknoxhq already built a great Blake2s hash-to-point for Falcon in Cairo — about 34 calls for 512 coefficients. Once 0.14.2 lands, we'll integrate it.  \n   238→https://github.com/ZKNoxHQ/falzkon/blob/main/contracts/src/blake2s_hash.cairo\n   239→\n   240→10/11\n   241→I'm building the client side too. Rust port of Falcon-512 with a generic hash trait. Keygen, signing, and verification all pass NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors. This will become the WASM signer for browser or mobile wallets. https://github.com/feltroidprime/falcon-rs\n   242→\n   243→11/11\n   244→The NTT costs 15k steps and the hash pipeline is ready. Next I'm wiring them into an actual account contract — a wallet on @Starknet that signs with Falcon-512. Let's go!\n   245→\n   246→---\n   247→"}]},"uuid":"f96f68c7-5d6b-4e8a-bfbd-bab423125ee7","timestamp":"2026-02-16T13:56:20.346Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"Thoroughly explore the /home/felt/PycharmProjects/s2morrow/scripts/thread/ directory.

The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n    20→\n    21→With 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Renyi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n    22→\n    23→---\n    24→\n    25→## Post 4\n    26→So I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n    27→\n    28→22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n    29→\n    30→> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## Post 5\n    35→The BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n    36→\n    37→But the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n    38→\n    39→---\n    40→\n    41→## Post 6\n    42→I also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n    43→\n    44→Two NTTs, zero INTTs.\n    45→\n    46→> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## Post 7\n    51→Then I found a free optimization. I originally wrote a custom absorb function for the Poseidon sponge — rate-2 absorption, padding, domain separation, the whole thing. Then I realized Cairo's built-in poseidon_hash_span does the exact same thing. Replaced 20 lines with one function call. 33% gas reduction on hash_to_point.\n    52→\n    53→---\n    54→\n    55→## Post 8\n    56→The next day I went on an optimization sprint. 7 commits in one afternoon.\n    57→\n    58→The verification had three separate 512-element loops: multiply and check the hint, subtract to get s0, compute both norms. I fused them into a single pass. Then unrolled with multi_pop_front K=8. 210k to 132k steps.\n    59→\n    60→> ATTACH: day5_optimization_waterfall.png\n    61→\n    62→---\n    63→\n    64→## Post 9\n    65→I also built a companion Rust crate (falcon-rs) with a generic hash trait — swap SHAKE256 for Poseidon. It passes NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors for standard Falcon. Same keygen and signing; only the hash changes.\n    66→\n    67→Rust generates all the Cairo test data. Cairo deserializes and checks element-by-element. 27 Cairo tests, 61 Rust tests. https://github.com/feltroidprime/falcon-rs\n    68→\n    69→---\n    70→\n    71→## Post 10\n    72→132k steps, down from 800k on Day 1. -83.5%.\n    73→\n    74→Next: wiring this into an actual account contract. __validate__ calls verify, public key in storage packed into 29 felt252 slots, signature + hint in calldata. When Blake2s ships in 0.14.2, @zknoxhq's hash-to-point drops in and we move toward spec-compliant Falcon on a live network. Let's see.\n    75→"}]},"uuid":"2190d5b0-dc82-446d-9964-a6d090887f8b","timestamp":"2026-02-16T13:56:28.564Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"Thoroughly explore the /home/felt/PycharmProjects/s2morrow/scripts/thread/ directory.

A Python-to-Cairo compiler that takes arithmetic circuits and generates fully unrolled felt252 code.

This is the core technical advantage.\n    85→\n    86→### BoundedInt arc\n    87→Day 2 introduced BoundedInt as the optimization. Day 3 built the compiler around it.

Too much. Profiled, found secp256r1 costs ~230k — that's the target. \"I have a theory on how to cut this in half. We'll see if I'm wrong tomorrow.\"\n   102→\n   103→### Day 2\n   104→Hook: \"I found a 65% overhead in the Falcon-512 verification. Not math related, it's just the CairoLang VM fighting itself. I've killed this pattern before and I'll do it again.\"\n   105→Content: 65% overhead from store_temp, array ops, downcasts. Cut 20% with BoundedInt.

Tease a result, a contrast, or something unexpected.\n2. **Work** — what I actually did, with code/screenshots/numbers.\n3. **Obstacle or insight** — pain points are content.\n4. **Results** — concrete numbers, anchored to something familiar.\n5. **Closer** — tease what's coming next with specific stakes. Not a summary.\n\nOne idea per post. Don't repeat ideas across posts — if the hook says it, the body doesn't say it again.\n\n## Format\n\n- Each thread quotes the previous one. Post 1 quotes the previous Day's tweet.\n- Hook starts with `[DAY X] of building a Quantum wallet for @Starknet.`\n- The closer should tease something specific with real stakes — \"If X happens, then Y.\" End with \"Let's see.\"\n- The last two posts (closer + second-to-last) are the most read after the hook. Make them count.\n\n## Running Narratives\n\n### Performance target\nDay 1 established ~230k Cairo steps as the target (cost of secp256r1 signature verification on Starknet). Every optimization is measured against this.\n\n### The compiler\nBuilt on Day 3. A Python-to-Cairo compiler that takes arithmetic circuits and generates fully unrolled felt252 code. It tracks worst-case bounds internally, computes shifts, and uses BoundedInt only at final reductions (felt252 hybrid mode). This is the core technical advantage.\n\n### BoundedInt arc\nDay 2 introduced BoundedInt as the optimization. Day 3 built the compiler around it. Day 4 corrected Day 2 — using BoundedInt for every op overwhelmed the compiler; the hybrid mode is the real win. This correction is an honest, running narrative.\n\n### zknox collaboration\n@zknoxhq (@RenaudDUBOIS10, @SimonMasson2) built a Falcon NTT in Cairo independently. Found through @asanso's PQ Ethereum working group. Two teams, complementary work — they have Blake2s hash-to-point, we have the faster NTT.\n\n### 230k steps budget breakdown\n- NTT: 15,353 steps (7% of budget) — solved\n- Hash-to-point: Poseidon available now, Blake2s coming April (Starknet 0.14.2)\n- Full verification circuit: open question — will it fit under 230k?\n\n## Previous Threads Summary\n\n### Day 1\nHook: \"Quantum computers will eventually break every wallet on Ethereum.\"\nContent: Cloned s2morrow, benchmarked Falcon-512 at ~800k steps. Too much. Profiled, found secp256r1 costs ~230k — that's the target. \"I have a theory on how to cut this in half. We'll see if I'm wrong tomorrow.\"\n\n### Day 2\nHook: \"I found a 65% overhead in the Falcon-512 verification. Not math related, it's just the CairoLang VM fighting itself. I've killed this pattern before and I'll do it again.\"\nContent: 65% overhead from store_temp, array ops, downcasts. Cut 20% with BoundedInt. Proposed bounded_int_circuit.py — a compiler for arithmetic circuits using BoundedInt. \"The fix is to use one fully inlined function. Probably ~4000 lines.\"\n\n### Day 3\nHook: \"Making gangster progress. Turned an elegant NTT algorithm into a brutal 30k-line assembly file. It's nasty but 5x faster.\"\nContent: Built BoundedIntCircuit class. Generated NTT — 34,431 steps vs 185,992. Mentioned bytecode-steps tradeoff. \"See you soon.\"\n\n### Day 4\nHook: \"Two teams independently wrote the same 10,000-line file. One runs 4x faster. The difference is one design decision.\"\nContent: Compared with zknox — shift strategy (every op vs once at end) and reduction width (u256 vs u128). BoundedInt correction (hybrid mode). Hash-to-point: skip rejection sampling via Falcon spec page 31. falcon-rs Rust port passing NIST test vectors. \"If the whole thing comes in under 230k steps, we have a deployable post-quantum account contract for @Starknet. Let's see.\"\n\n## Open Threads for Day 5\n\n- Full Falcon verification circuit — does it fit under 230k?\n- Hash-to-point implementation with Poseidon\n- Account contract integration\n- Bytecode-steps tradeoff (mentioned Day 3, never resolved)\n- Blake2s integration when 0.14.2 drops\n","numLines":122,"startLine":1,"totalLines":122}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f53a004a-e7bc-4653-a29f-f85eab375982"}

Let me look at how previous threads handle this. The `reply_to:` directive sets the reply-to URL, but the user wants a quote tweet instead. Let me check the Typefully API and the thread.py code to understand the difference between reply_to and quote.\n\nLooking at the thread.py code, the `reply_to_url` is set via:\n```python\nbody[\"platforms\"][\"x\"][\"settings\"][\"reply_to_url\"] = reply_to_url\n```\n\nBut for a quote tweet, the Typefully API likely uses a different field. Let me check the API docs again, or look at how previous threads were published. \n\nI'm noticing the Day 4 thread header mentions \"quote Day 3\" but there's no `reply_to:` directive in the actual markdown. So either the quoting was handled manually in Typefully, or there's a different mechanism I'm missing for setting up quote tweets versus replies.\n\nLooking at how Typefully's API works, I think the `reply_to_url` field might actually handle quote tweets, or the simpler approach is just embedding the tweet URL directly in the text—X automatically renders that as a quote tweet. Let me check the published Day 4 post to see how it actually appeared. I need to figure out whether Typefully's API supports quote tweets directly, or if I should just include the Day 4 URL in the post text itself—which is how X renders quote tweets natively. Let me check what the previous threads actually did to match that pattern.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":36,"cache_read_input_tokens":99222,"cache_creation":{

On X/Twitter, the standard way to create a quote tweet is to include the URL of the tweet you want to quote in your tweet text. When you include a tweet URL in the text, X renders it as a quote tweet.\n\nSo the fix is simple: change `reply_to:` to be embedded in the first post's text instead. Or keep the `reply_to:` as a reply (threading under the previous day), AND also include the URL in Post 1's text to make it a quote tweet.\n\nWait, actually thinking about this more carefully:\n- `reply_to_url` makes the thread a *reply* to Day 4 (appears in Day 4's reply thread)\n\n\n- Including the URL in Post 1's text makes it a *quote tweet* (shows Day 4 embedded)\n\nThey're different things. The user wants to QUOTE Day 4, like previous threads. I need to understand what `reply_to_url` actually does in Typefully—does it create a reply or a quote tweet? On X, a quote tweet shares someone's tweet with your own comment on top, while a reply responds in the thread under someone's tweet. Let me check the Day 4 published tweet to see what we're working with.\n\nLooking at the URLs: Day 2 is at https://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2016632991892853245, Day 3 at https://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2017277443510514149, and Day 4 at https://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2021250459210743914. The Day 4 thread.md shows `reply_to: https://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2017277443510514149` (Day 3's URL), but on Twitter it appears as a quote tweet. I'm wondering if Typefully's `reply_to_url` actually creates a quote tweet rather than a traditional reply. Actually, checking the Day 4 thread.md file more carefully, it doesn't seem to have a `reply_to:` line at all.\n\nLet me look at the actual content again. The Day 4 thread.md shows a hook that quotes Day 3, but there's no `reply_to:` directive in the file. So either Day 4 was pushed without the quote and it was added manually in Typefully, or the quoting happened through a different mechanism. The simplest explanation is that on X/Twitter, you create a quote tweet by just including the tweet URL in your post text—when X detects a tweet URL at the end, it automatically renders it as a quote tweet with the referenced tweet embedded below. So the fix would be to remove any `reply_to:` line (which creates a reply instead) and add the tweet URL directly to the post text.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":582,"cache_read_input_tokens":101834,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":582},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBsywnYjkG82rhvgPXoL","type":"assistant","uuid":"217dd222-efa9-4887-98bc-d99dfcdf1bb1","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:09:00.761Z"}

The 230k target from Day 1 is beaten.\n\n---\n\n## Post 2\nThe hash function was the interesting design problem. Falcon needs to hash a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling: extract 16 bits, reject if biased, retry. That's branching and variable-length loops, expensive in a ZK VM.\n\nBlake2s would be ideal — native opcode, 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon — but I asked @Starkware and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is.\n\n---\n\n## Post 3\nI looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely and extract more bits per coefficient instead. The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n\nWith 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Renyi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n\n---\n\n## Post 4\nSo I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n\n22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 5\nThe BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n\nBut the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n\n---\n\n## Post 6\nI also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n\nTwo NTTs, zero INTTs.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 7\nThen I found a free optimization. I originally wrote a custom absorb function for the Poseidon sponge — rate-2 absorption, padding, domain separation, the whole thing. Then I realized Cairo's built-in poseidon_hash_span does the exact same thing. Replaced 20 lines with one function call. 33% gas reduction on hash_to_point.\n\n---\n\n## Post 8\nThe next day I went on an optimization sprint. 7 commits in one afternoon.\n\nThe verification had three separate 512-element loops: multiply and check the hint, subtract to get s0, compute both norms. I fused them into a single pass. Then unrolled with multi_pop_front K=8. 210k to 132k steps.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_optimization_waterfall.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 9\nI also built a companion Rust crate (falcon-rs) with a generic hash trait — swap SHAKE256 for Poseidon. It passes NIST's 100 known-answer test vectors for standard Falcon. Same keygen and signing; only the hash changes.\n\nRust generates all the Cairo test data. Cairo deserializes and checks element-by-element. 27 Cairo tests, 61 Rust tests. https://github.com/feltroidprime/falcon-rs\n\n---\n\n## Post 10\n132k steps, down from 800k on Day 1. -83.5%.\n\nNext: wiring this into an actual account contract. __validate__ calls verify, public key in storage packed into 29 felt252 slots, signature + hint in calldata. When Blake2s ships in 0.14.2, @zknoxhq's hash-to-point drops in and we move toward spec-compliant Falcon on a live network.

This means the feature exists in Typefully's system but may not be documented in their public API docs. \n\nLet me think about this differently - maybe it's a field that exists but isn't documented. The web UI converts a pasted URL into a quote tweet. This could mean the post object has a field like `quote_source_url` or similar that isn't in the public docs.\n\nI could try a few approaches:\n1. Look at the fetched draft data from Typefully to see if published threads that had quote tweets have any extra fields\n\n\n2. Just try adding a `quote_source_url` or `quote_url` field to the post object and see what happens\n3. Check if the existing `reply_to_url` actually creates a quote tweet instead of a reply\n\nLet me examine the Day 4 draft since it was a quote of Day 3 - that should show me what fields are actually present when a quote tweet gets published.\n\nI'll start by testing the most likely field names. The web UI shows a \"convert to quote\" option when you paste a URL, which suggests the post object probably has something like `quote_source_url` alongside the standard `text` and `media_ids` fields.

And there's something weird - `enabled` should be `False`? That seems like a bug in the API or maybe I need to pass it differently.\n\nWait, the validation says \"Input should be False\" for `enabled`. That's weird... unless this account/social set doesn't have X enabled. But we've been pushing to X successfully before.\n\nLet me look at the error more carefully. The `function-wrap[_run_root_validator()]` suggests this is a Pydantic model. The validator might be doing something specific.\n\nActually wait - the error shows `extra_forbidden` for `posts` and `settings` too, which means the entire x platform config is being rejected. \n\nThe `enabled: False` requirement is confusing since previous pushes worked with it set to `True`, but maybe the issue is just that `quote_source_url` isn't a valid field. Let me try alternative field names like `quote_url` or `quote_tweet_url` in settings, or just embed the URL directly in the post text like I've been doing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1219,"cache_read_input_tokens":107859,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1219},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBtFiubozUixJzgfg6SK","type":"assistant","uuid":"6718a86d-3e98-48da-b3ac-3a2b25cd4a66","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:12:29.005Z"}

The API is strict about not accepting unknown fields. The quote tweet functionality in Typefully's web UI is likely handled client-side (detecting URLs and offering to convert them to quotes), and then stored as some internal representation that isn't exposed through the public API.\n\nSo our best option is what we already have: include the Day 4 tweet URL in the text of Post 1. On X, when a tweet URL is included in the text, it renders as a quote tweet.\n\nHowever, there's one more thing to try - maybe we need to use the `reply_to_url` but it actually creates a quote tweet, not a reply. \n\nThe user mentioned seeing a \"convert to quote\" button in Typefully's web interface when pasting a link, which suggests this transformation happens client-side and gets stored in a way the public API doesn't expose. So sticking with the URL embedded in Post 1's text is the right approach—X will render it as a quote tweet automatically.\n\nI should let them know the API doesn't have native quote tweet support, but placing the URL in the text achieves the same visual result on X, and they can always use Typefully's web UI to convert it if needed.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1434,"cache_read_input_tokens":109078,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1434},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBtHFnW8ufUAT8JAjqNf","type":"assistant","uuid":"583bc378-0127-4e7b-99cb-66d7bb7d7823","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:12:49.355Z"}

Let me look at the profile PNGs which show the call graphs with step counts, or use the `.pb.gz` protobuf files.\n\nThe relevant verify-e2e profiles at each commit are:\n- `26-02-12-17:13_falcon_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_a00d9f5.pb.gz` (baseline before optimization sprint)\n- `26-02-12-17:33_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_86f1981.pb.gz`\n\n\n- `26-02-12-17:57_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_c0e7510.pb.gz` (docs commit, same as 08ed84e perf)\n- `26-02-12-18:15_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_027e3a9.pb.gz`\n- `26-02-12-18:18_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_5b52758.pb.gz` or `26-02-12-18:23_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_5b52758.pb.gz`\n- `26-02-12-18:29_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_...pb.gz` and continuing through the rest of the optimization sprint commits.\n\nI'm also noticing there's a baseline profile from before the optimization work started, and I need to check if there's a profile for the K=8 unroll commit.

Works with both `scarb execute` (standalone programs) and `snforge test` (Starknet Foundry tests).\n\nIf tools are missing, see `installation.md` in this skill directory. The CLI script is `profile.py` in this skill directory.\n\n## REQUIRED: Use the CLI\n\n**Always use `python3 profile.py profile` (from this skill directory) for profiling.** Do NOT run snforge/cairo-profiler/pprof manually — the CLI handles the full pipeline deterministically (trace generation, profile building, PNG export, naming).\n\n### snforge mode (test functions)\n\n```bash\npython3 profile.py profile \\\n  --mode snforge \\\n  --package falcon \\\n  --test test_ntt_zknox_vs_felt252 \\\n  --name ntt-zknox-reduced \\\n  --metric steps\n```\n\n### scarb mode (standalone executables)\n\n```bash\npython3 profile.py profile \\\n  --mode scarb \\\n  --package falcon \\\n  --executable bench_ntt \\\n  --args-file tests/data/ntt_input_512.json \\\n  --name ntt-felt252 \\\n  --metric steps\n```\n\n### CLI arguments\n\n| Argument | Required | Description |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| `--mode` | yes | `snforge` or `scarb` |\n| `--package` | yes | Scarb package name (e.g. `falcon`) |\n| `--name` | yes | Human-friendly profile label (e.g. `ntt-zknox-reduced`) |\n| `--test` | snforge | Test filter passed to `snforge test` |\n| `--executable` | scarb | Executable name for `scarb execute` |\n| `--args-file` | no | Arguments file for `scarb execute` |\n| `--metric` | no | `steps` (default), `rc`, `sierra-gas`, `l2-gas` |\n| `--output` | no | Output directory (default: `profiles/`) |\n| `--nodefraction` | no | Hide PNG nodes below this fraction of total (default: `0.005`). Use `0` to show all nodes. |\n| `--edgefraction` | no | Hide PNG edges below this fraction of total (default: `0.001`). Use `0` to show all edges. |\n\n### CLI exit codes — act on errors\n\n| Code | Meaning | What to do |\n|------|---------|------------|\n| 0 | Success | Read the PNG path from output |\n| 1 | Argument error | Fix the CLI invocation |\n| 2 | snforge/scarb failed | Check compilation errors, test failures |\n| 3 | Trace file not found | Test must PASS to produce a trace. Check test name matches exactly. |\n| 4 | cairo-profiler failed | Check trace JSON is valid |\n| 5 | pprof PNG export failed | Check graphviz is installed (`apt install graphviz`) |\n| 6 | Missing tool | Install the missing tool (see `installation.md`) |\n\n### Output\n\nThe CLI produces two files in `profiles/`:\n```\nprofiles/YY-MM-DD-HH:MM_<package>_<name>_<metric>_<commit>.pb.gz\nprofiles/YY-MM-DD-HH:MM_<package>_<name>_<metric>_<commit>.png\n```\n\nAfter running the CLI, **always read the PNG** to verify the profile shows the expected functions.\n\n## Pitfalls\n\n### Stale trace files\n\n`snfoundry_trace/` keeps old traces. If you change code and re-profile, you MUST re-run `snforge test --save-trace-data` (the CLI does this automatically). **Never build a profile from a trace that predates your code change.**\n\n### Missing functions in the PNG\n\nIf a function doesn't appear in the PNG, it may be below the `--nodefraction` threshold. Use `--nodefraction 0` to show all nodes. You can also check the text output (printed by the CLI) — functions with 0 flat steps but high cumulative steps are wrappers that delegate all work to callees.\n\n### Timestamp mismatch between pb.gz and png\n\nWhen running steps manually, the pb.gz and png may get different timestamps if they cross a minute boundary. The CLI computes the timestamp once so both files always match.\n\n## Manual profiling (advanced)\n\nFor interactive exploration beyond what the CLI provides:\n\n```bash\n# Launch web UI for interactive flame graphs\npprof -http=:8080 profiles/<name>.pb.gz\n\n# View specific sample in terminal\ncairo-profiler view profiles/<name>.pb.gz --sample steps --limit 20\n\n# List available samples\ncairo-profiler view profiles/<name>.pb.gz --list-samples\n```\n\n## Metric reference\n\n| `--metric` | tracked-resource | Samples in profile |\n|------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| `steps` | `cairo-steps` | steps, calls, range check builtin, memory holes, casm size |\n| `rc` | `cairo-steps` | (same as steps, PNG shows range check builtin) |\n| `sierra-gas` | `sierra-gas` | sierra gas, calls, casm size |\n| `l2-gas` | `sierra-gas` | l2 gas (requires `enable-gas = true` + dispatcher pattern) |\n\n## L2 Gas profiling (snforge)\n\nL2 gas requires **all three**:\n\n1. `[cairo] enable-gas = true` in Scarb.toml\n2. `--metric l2-gas` (uses sierra-gas tracking)\n3. **Dispatcher pattern** — profiled code must run inside a deployed contract\n\n```cairo\n#[starknet::interface]\ntrait IBench<TContractState> {\n    fn my_function(self: @TContractState) -> felt252;\n}\n\n#[starknet::contract]\nmod bench { /* ... */ }\n\n// Test using dispatcher\n#[test]\nfn bench_my_function() {\n    let contract = declare(\"bench\").unwrap().contract_class();\n    let (addr, _) = contract.deploy(@array![]).unwrap();\n    let dispatcher = IBenchDispatcher { contract_address: addr };\n    dispatcher.my_function();\n}\n```\n\n**Known limitation:** Syscall execution costs (secp256r1, keccak, etc.) are not attributed in the l2 gas profile. Use snforge test output for total gas; use profiler for relative hotspot analysis within Cairo code.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"a0ad1f2f-ce12-44f7-9567-07c03e8c856d","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:17:19.275Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_016rx1ahKhBmVSmjyVcHss5z"}

I can use `cairo-profiler view` to get the step counts for the verify function at each commit. Let me identify the relevant profile files and extract the verify function costs.\n\nThe relevant profiles are:\n- `26-02-11-20:59_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_4158622.pb.gz` — baseline before sprint\n- `26-02-12-17:13_falcon_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_a00d9f5.pb.gz` — a00d9f5 (docs commit after u16→Zq)\n\n\n- `26-02-12-17:33_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_86f1981.pb.gz` — 86f1981 (remove u16/u32 intermediates)\n- `26-02-12-17:57_falcon_verify-e2e_steps_c0e7510.pb.gz` — c0e7510 (after felt252 alloc fix)\n- And one more profile from around 18:15 that I need to locate — 027e3a9 (BoundedInt norm), followed by a couple of iterations on fusing sub+norm operations, and finally a1f5ed9 after applying all the fusions.\n\nNow I'm checking whether there's a profile for the unroll K=8 commit (58e8154) that comes after a1f5ed9, since a1f5ed9 is a docs commit following the main fusion work. I'll use the profiler to extract the verify function costs from each profile to compare the performance across these optimization stages.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1817,"cache_read_input_tokens":116937,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1817},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBte5xz5LR6432mJgnSb","type":"assistant","uuid":"598eb386-3498-44ba-b3cf-4c55543ca432","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:17:36.295Z"}

Let me search for it. The function is likely `falcon::falcon::verify` or `falcon::falcon::verify_with_msg_point`. The top-level function would have high cumulative but low flat steps.\n\nLooking at the output:\n- `falcon::falcon::extend_euclidean_norm` has cum 40,934 steps\n- `falcon::ntt::ntt_fast` variants have cum 15,388 and 19,484\n- `falcon::ntt::mul_ntt` has cum 17,936\n\n\n- `falcon::ntt::sub_zq` has cum 18,448\n- `falcon::ntt::intt_with_hint` has cum 10,254\n- `falcon::hash_to_point` has cum 5,988\n\nThe verify function is probably not showing up in the top 30 by flat steps since it's a wrapper, so I need to either increase the limit or search for it directly. Actually, this is the end-to-end test which includes deserialization overhead, so I should look for the verify function's cumulative cost with a higher limit or grep for it specifically.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2149,"cache_read_input_tokens":118754,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2149},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBtfMjYkuQ91yoydjcbV","type":"assistant","uuid":"8f1ccd29-ae77-4a57-b0cc-db85a3484c32","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:17:46.098Z"}

Let me look at the function names more carefully. The `verify_with_msg_point` has cum 56,623 and there's a specific range `verify_with_msg_point[1292-3564]` with cum 26,316. Also it looks like total test steps are 504,421, which is much larger than before, suggesting this test is running multiple verifications.\n\nActually wait - this profile (`a1f5ed9`) seems to be from a different test than the others. The file name says `verify-e2e` but the content shows `test_verify_hint`. \n\nI don't see a `falcon::falcon::verify` function in the grep results, just `falcon::falcon::verify_with_msg_point` with cum 56,623 steps. This profile is likely from a different test run, and given the commit timeline - 68680dc (fuse all) and a1f5ed9 (docs after it) would be after the major refactoring. Let me check what the final commit 58e8154 (unroll K=8) shows.\n\nThe user has a profile at `26-02-12-20:11_falcon_verify-rust_steps_a1f5ed9.pb.gz` which might be the test_verify_matches_rust test. Looking at a1f5ed9 more carefully, there are actually two `verify_with_msg_point` entries - one with 26,316 steps for a specific line range and another with 56,623 - and the total test runs 504,421 steps which includes a lot of serialization and deserialization overhead. I need to check if there's a profile for the final state after 58e8154, or generate a new one.\n\nNow I'm looking at the verify-rust profile to see the combined cost of hash_to_point and verify_with_msg_point together.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":737,"cache_read_input_tokens":122605,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":737},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBtiYGdpFoCP7ZptWLBK","type":"assistant","uuid":"4e19f33b-1e58-4fcf-95b6-dc1fa338bd80","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:18:34.393Z"}

That means the unroll K=8 commit (58e8154) didn't change the verify function's step count. Let me check what that commit actually changed.Wait, let me also check the a1f5ed9 profile more carefully. I used the `verify-rust` profile for a1f5ed9 which showed 63,177. But there's also the `verify-e2e` profile at a1f5ed9. Let me double-check — the `verify-e2e` at a1f5ed9 was a different test (test_verify_hint). So the verify-rust profile at a1f5ed9 is the correct one to compare with (test_verify_matches_rust).\n\n\nNow I'm looking at the cumulative step counts for `falcon::falcon::verify` across the commits in this sprint. The data shows a clear progression of optimizations — starting from 159,403 steps at the baseline, then dropping significantly after the u16 to Zq conversion, further improvements from removing intermediate types, and substantial gains from the felt252 allocation fix.\n\nBut I'm noticing something inconsistent: commit f116483 shows 76,295 steps after fusing sub and norm operations, yet a1f5ed9 shows 63,177 steps after fusing all operations with commit 68680dc. The issue is that f116483 and 68680dc are different commits, so the step counts should reflect different optimization points. Also, the unroll K=8 optimization at HEAD (58e8154) didn't change the verify cost at all compared to a1f5ed9, which is surprising since that unroll should have had some impact on the function's performance. Let me investigate what 58e8154 actually changed and whether it affected the verify path.\n\nLooking at the commit chain more carefully, between a1f5ed9 and the current HEAD there's the unroll optimization and a formatter change, but the profile shows the same 63,177 cost at HEAD (931a208). I need to verify which commit we're actually on and whether the profile is capturing the right state. Looking at the performance metrics, the verify function shows 63,177 steps at HEAD, which matches the earlier commit a1f5ed9, and verify_with_msg_point is at 26,301 steps — also unchanged. The unroll commit with K=8 might have already been incorporated in an earlier fused implementation, or it only affected a different part of the code path.\n\nSince the unroll isn't showing as a distinct improvement in the verify cost, the waterfall should end at 63,177 rather than treating it as a separate step. I'm realizing the \"132k\" mentioned in the plan might refer to total test cost rather than just the verify function, so I need to recalculate using verify-specific costs. The baseline test was 215,260 steps and a1f5ed9 was 119,007, so I should build the waterfall tracking verify function costs specifically.\n\nNow I need to check whether the a00d9f5 profile captures only d5b4c39 or includes 86f1981 as well.\n\nLooking at the commit order: d5b4c39 replaces u16 with Zq, then a00d9f5 is a docs commit, then 86f1981 removes u16/u32 intermediates. So the profile at a00d9f5 captures d5b4c39 but not 86f1981.\n\nNow I'm building out the waterfall table to show how each optimization compounds—starting from the baseline of 159,403 steps, then the u16→Zq refactor brings it down to 133,245, and subsequent commits like removing intermediates, the felt252 allocation fix, and the BoundedInt norm optimization each layer on top of the previous improvements. Looking at the breakdown more carefully, the u16→Zq refactoring and removing intermediates were distinct improvements that combined for about 27% savings, while the subsequent optimizations like fusing operations and eliminating allocations drove the remaining gains down to the final 63k cost. I see the discrepancy now—the original plan was based on total test costs, but the user wants me to focus specifically on the verify function costs instead. That shifts the numbers dramatically from 210k → 132k down to 159k → 63k, which is a much more impressive -60% reduction. I need to update the waterfall chart data and the thread posts that reference these numbers to reflect the verify function costs rather than the global test cost.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering how to label the optimization steps in the waterfall chart. Some commits labeled as refactoring actually have meaningful performance impacts—like the u16 to Zq conversion and removing intermediate values. I could group the first two steps together since they're both about the BoundedInt theme, but keeping all eight bars separate makes sense since each represents a distinct optimization captured in the profiles.

Let's see.","originalFile":"# Day 5 Thread\n\n## Post 1\n[DAY 5] of building a Quantum wallet for @Starknet. I built the full Falcon-512 verification in one afternoon — types, hash function, signature checking, cross-language tests. Then spent the next afternoon cutting verify() by 60%.\n\n63k steps for the verify function alone. The 230k full budget from Day 1 is comfortably beaten.\n\nhttps://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2021250459210743914\n\n---\n\n## Post 2\nThe hash function was the interesting design problem. Falcon needs to hash a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling: extract 16 bits, reject if biased, retry. That's branching and variable-length loops, expensive in a ZK VM.\n\nBlake2s would be ideal — native opcode, 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon — but I asked @Starkware and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is.\n\n---\n\n## Post 3\nI looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely and extract more bits per coefficient instead. The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n\nWith 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Renyi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n\n---\n\n## Post 4\nSo I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n\n22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 5\nThe BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n\nBut the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n\n---\n\n## Post 6\nI also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n\nTwo NTTs, zero INTTs.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 7\nThen I found a free optimization.

At 4158622 (docs commit after package split), verify = 159,403. So between ba0471a and 4158622 the verify cost barely changed (just 19 steps difference — negligible, probably from the package split/refactoring).\n\nNow I need to check even earlier. The commit 45e3bcc was \"feat(falcon): add hint-based verify function with msg_point test\". There's no profile for it, but I need to check what came before that. Actually, there was also a commit f1308af \"fix(falcon): address code review — consolidate Q_CONST, add e2e verify test\" — that's when the e2e test was added.\n\n\nLooking at the available profiles, ba0471a is the earliest one with a verify measurement at 159,422 steps. The later profiles show the hint-based and e2e verify tests at 4158622, but 45e3bcc (which introduced the hint-based verify) doesn't have a profile. So I'm trying to trace back when the verify cost actually changed, but ba0471a seems to be my earliest data point. them:\n- 45e3bcc: first hint verify\n- 24aa22d: code review fixes\n- 773d335: cross-language tests\n- f1308af: consolidate Q_CONST, add e2e verify test\n- ba0471a: poseidon_hash_span refactor (profile: 159,422)\n\nThe ba0471a commit specifically says \"use poseidon_hash_span for absorption\" — this was the \"33% gas reduction on hash_to_point\" mentioned in the thread. So the verify cost BEFORE this refactor would have been higher.\n\nLet me check if the test existed at f1308af (before the poseidon_hash_span refactor). If yes, I can profile it by checking out that commit.\n\nBut wait — I can only profile the current code, not old commits, without checking out. Looking at the profiles directory, I see there's a verify-hint profile and a hash-to-point only profile, but nothing from before the ba0471a refactor. To show the full journey like the user wants, I'd need to check out an earlier commit and profile it — probably from around 45e3bcc when the verify function first landed, then compare it to the current state after the poseidon_hash_span optimization. I'm realizing the user probably means the current `falcon::falcon::verify` function with the hint-based approach, which was introduced around commit `45e3bcc`. I could check out that commit in a temporary worktree to profile the old version without disrupting my current work, though that adds complexity.\n\nLooking at the available profiles, `ba0471a` is the poseidon_hash_span refactor commit itself, so that profile already includes the optimization. To see the cost before that change, I'd need to look at `f1308af` instead. I'm also noticing there are other profiles like the legacy verify one that might give me the baseline numbers I'm looking

But this test runs multiple verifications (it has `test_verify_with_msg_point[557-618]`, `[665-728]`, `[777-835]` — three instances at 7,694 each). The total test is 601,680 steps.\n\nWait — looking more carefully, the `falcon::falcon::verify_with_msg_point` shows 152,864 cumulative. But the test function shows 601,680. If the test runs multiple verify calls, the 152,864 might be just one call. \n\nThere's no separate `falcon::falcon::verify` entry in the profile, which makes sense since `test_verify_hint` likely calls `verify_with_msg_point` directly rather than going through the full `verify` function that wraps it with hash_to_point. Looking at the key performance numbers across versions: legacy `verify_uncompressed` was 824,090 steps, then `verify` dropped to 159,422 at ba0471a and stayed around 159,403 at sprint start, with the sprint itself targeting 133,245 steps.\n\nThe progression from 117,836 down to 63,177 shows the cumulative impact of optimizations. The massive jump from 824k to 159k came from switching to the hint-based approach with 2 NTTs and 0 INTTs, plus the NTT compiler improvements. For the waterfall visualization, I need to show the legacy baseline, the first hint-based version, and then the sprint progression, but the scale difference is huge—the sprint bars will look tiny compared to the legacy number. I could either split this into two groups or add a text annotation to make the progression clearer.\n\nLooking back at what the user asked for, they want the cost from \"the first time we had this verify function\"—which is the hint-based `falcon::verify`, not the old `verify_uncompressed`. The first profile of that is at commit ba0471a with a cost of 159,422. There's no real intermediate data point between that and the sprint start since they're essentially the same cost. The 824k was a completely different function from the legacy code. The user might be asking me to show the cost before the poseidon_hash_span optimization, which would require profiling an earlier commit, but that's not straightforward without checking out old code. Let me reconsider what they're actually asking for—they might just want me to include the baseline cost before the optimizations kicked in. I need to figure out what data I actually have access to. The legacy verify_uncompressed at 824,090 cycles is a completely different code path from the hint-based approach, so the gap between that and the 159k figure after the hash_span optimization represents multiple architectural changes bundled together — the hint system itself, the compiled NTT from Day 3, and the Poseidon hash-to-point implementation all happening in that initial push.","signature":"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

The total test is 223,285. The difference from ba0471a (159,422 for verify) might be that at f1308af, the `verify` function wrapper didn't exist yet, or it was structured differently.\n\nWait — at ba0471a the `verify` function is 159,422 and `verify_with_msg_point` would be inside it. At f1308af there's no `verify` entry, only `verify_with_msg_point` at 152,937. So at f1308af, the test might call `verify_with_msg_point` directly instead of going through `verify`.\n \nNow I'm checking what `verify` actually does — it wraps `hash_to_point` and then calls `verify_with_msg_point`. Looking at the numbers, if `hash_to_point` was around 5,988 steps at ba0471a, then the cost breakdown would be roughly `verify_with_msg_point` plus that hashing overhead, which aligns with why the direct call at f1308af is lower.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":417,"cache_read_input_tokens":149778,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":417},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYBunNAQJMn7GYnWhmtLK","type":"assistant","uuid":"ae62837f-1885-4761-b4b2-6ef1c1bf2fd7","timestamp":"2026-02-16T14:32:29.853Z"}

When I try to visualize this as a waterfall showing the progression from legacy to the hint-based approach, the jump from 824k down to 167k is so massive it would completely dominate the chart and obscure all the smaller optimizations that happened afterward.\n\nI think the cleanest approach is to focus on the hint-based verify journey itself: starting with the first implementation at 167,448, then showing the poseidon_hash_span optimization bringing it to 159,403, followed by the sprint improvements through u16→Zq and the remaining optimizations down to 63,177. That gives me eight bars total, which displays the progression clearly without the legacy outlier throwing off the scale. And the first bar adds context about the hash optimization.\n\nHmm, but the user said \"from the first time we had this verify function.\" I think they just want me to include the starting cost before the sprint optimizations more prominently, and possibly the legacy number for reference. Let me add the pre-hash-optimization cost and keep the legacy as a reference line.\n\nSo I'm looking at the commit history across those two days. On Feb 11, there's the initial implementation hitting around 167,448, then the hash_span optimization bringing it down to 159,403. Then Feb 12 has a series of rapid improvements—converting types, removing intermediates, adjusting allocations, normalizing integers—each one chipping away at the cost until we're down to around 91,213.\n\nThen the final push with the fused compute_norm and fuse all optimizations gets us to 63,177. For the waterfall chart, I'm thinking the clearest story is to show the starting point right after the hash optimization, then each sprint step as a separate bar, so the user can see the cumulative effect of each optimization decision. I'm deciding whether to include an even earlier profile from the initial commit that introduced the hint-based verify function, but the performance changes between then and now were mostly code review fixes rather than optimizations, so the costs should be nearly identical. I'll stick with the pre-hash and post-hash data points I already have to show the progression before the sprint

This test total is 562,793 which is much more than just verify.\n\nSo at the earliest hint-based commit (45e3bcc):\n\n\n- `verify_with_msg_point` alone = 152,883 (no hash_to_point yet — test provides msg_point directly)\n- `verify_uncompressed` (old code) = 390,565\n\nBut 45e3bcc didn't have a `verify()` function yet, just `verify_with_msg_point`. The `verify` wrapper with hash_to_point came later, so I can't really compare \"verify = X\" at this commit. I need to focus on what data points are actually available here.\n\nThe legacy profile showed verify_uncompressed at 824,090, but at 45e3bcc it's 390,565 — that's a significant drop. The difference is that the legacy profile predates the NTT compiler from Day 3, whereas at 45e3bcc the compiled NTT (ntt_512 = 60,484) was already in place. The old recursive NTT (intt = 247,938) was still being used for verify_uncompressed, so the cost decreased from 824k down to 390k as the compiler optimizations took effect.\n\nBut the real breakthrough came with the hint-based approach, which eliminated the INTT entirely and dropped verify_uncompressed all the way down to 152k. Now I'm compiling the full timeline of performance metrics across these different versions and approaches.\n\nLooking at the progression from the legacy implementation through the NTT compiler improvements and into the hint-based verification, I can see the dramatic gains at each stage. The sprint data shows a particularly aggressive optimization curve, dropping from 133k down to 63k in a series of improvements. For the waterfall chart, I want to focus on the most impactful milestones—starting with the initial hint-based verify implementation and then showing how the subsequent optimizations built on that foundation. I'm deciding whether to include the computed f1308af value or stick only to direct profile measurements—the user asked for exact sources of truth, so the earliest reliable direct measurement is ba0471a at 159,422, which essentially matches the sprint start. The legacy 824k reference line will provide the context for improvement.\n\nI can also layer in the verify_uncompressed measurements to show the NTT compiler's impact: 824k on Day 1 without it, dropping to 390k by Day 3 with it, then the final verify() on Day 5—this gives a clearer narrative of the optimization journey. I'm settling on including the legacy verify cost as the first bar for comparison—the NTT compiler version at 390,565 gives a fair baseline—and then showing the sprint progression from there, with the Day 1 number as a reference point to show how much ground we've

I built the full Falcon-512 verification in one afternoon — types, hash function, signature checking, cross-language tests. Then spent the next afternoon cutting verify() by 60%.\n\n63k steps for the verify function alone. The 230k full budget from Day 1 is comfortably beaten.\n\nhttps://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2021250459210743914\n\n---\n\n## Post 2\nThe hash function was the interesting design problem. Falcon needs to hash a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling: extract 16 bits, reject if biased, retry. That's branching and variable-length loops, expensive in a ZK VM.\n\nBlake2s would be ideal — native opcode, 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon — but I asked @Starkware and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is.\n\n---\n\n## Post 3\nI looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely and extract more bits per coefficient instead. The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n\nWith 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Renyi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n\n---\n\n## Post 4\nSo I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n\n22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 5\nThe BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n\nBut the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n\n---\n\n## Post 6\nI also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n\nTwo NTTs, zero INTTs.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 7\nThen I found a free optimization.

I built the full Falcon-512 verification in one afternoon — types, hash function, signature checking, cross-language tests. Then spent the next afternoon cutting verify() from 159k to 63k steps.\n\n824k on Day 1. 63k now. -92%.\n\nhttps://x.com/feltroidPrime/status/2021250459210743914\n\n---\n\n## Post 2\nThe hash function was the interesting design problem. Falcon needs to hash a message into 512 coefficients mod 12289. The spec uses SHAKE256 with rejection sampling: extract 16 bits, reject if biased, retry. That's branching and variable-length loops, expensive in a ZK VM.\n\nBlake2s would be ideal — native opcode, 2-3x cheaper than Poseidon — but I asked @Starkware and it won't be available to contracts until 0.14.2 in April. Poseidon it is.\n\n---\n\n## Post 3\nI looked at how @0xMiden does their Falcon with Poseidon2. They skip rejection entirely and extract more bits per coefficient instead. The trick is in the Falcon spec itself (page 31): if your hash output is much larger than q, the modular bias becomes negligible.\n\nWith 16-bit inputs some residues get 25% more pre-images than others. With 128-bit inputs the bias is parts per 10^38. A Renyi divergence argument makes it formal. Minimum safe is ~50 bits; we extract from 128. Overkill.\n\n---\n\n## Post 4\nSo I built base-Q extraction chains. Each Poseidon output is a felt252 — 251 bits. Split into a low u128 and a high 124-bit part, then extract coefficients with repeated DivRem-by-q: divide, take remainder, repeat. 6 from each half. 12 coefficients per felt252.\n\n22 Poseidon permutations for all 512 coefficients. No rejection, no branching, no variable-length loops.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_extraction_chain.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 5\nThe BoundedInt type chains for this are painful though. Each DivRem step needs exact quotient and remainder types. Two separate chains because u128 and FeltHigh have different upper bounds. 40+ type definitions just for the extraction logic.\n\nBut the compiler uses those bounds to skip every overflow check. Without BoundedInt each division needs a u256 intermediate and a try_into cast back down — doubling the cost. Same lesson from Day 2: the pain pays for itself.\n\n---\n\n## Post 6\nI also moved the INTT off-chain. Standard Falcon: NTT the signature, multiply by public key, INTT back, check norm. Three transforms. Instead, the signer computes mul_hint = INTT(NTT(s1) * pk_ntt) and sends it alongside the signature. The verifier just re-checks the forward direction: NTT(mul_hint) == NTT(s1) * pk_ntt.\n\nTwo NTTs, zero INTTs.\n\n> ATTACH: day5_verify_flow.png\n\n---\n\n## Post 7\nThen I found a free optimization.
